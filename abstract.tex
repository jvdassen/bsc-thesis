A financial service provider in Zurich maintains a bonus program to incentivize credit and debit card usage. The process of exchanging bonus points against goods implied efforts to maintain contracts with partners and led to low usage of the program by customers. This led to the development of the Bazo cryptocurrency at the University of Zurich, which is an invite-only, blockchain based currency. In order to let the financial service provider evaluate the technology, further development efforts were taken to enrich the ecosystem of the currency. The scope of this thesis is the design, development and evaluation of a payment application for the Bazo cryptocurrency. Besides the development of the application, this thesis explores related topics, such as a comparison of Web API's with native applications by developing a Proof Of Concept. Further, the development efforts for the required interfaces to the currency and to the companys existing infrastructure are explored. Finally, a mobile port the existing client application from the Bazo currency to the android mobile operating system was created and evaluated.
